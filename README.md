This isn't really a project so much as just random files written in C# so that I have a reference for when I am coding later. 
Personally I like being able to code something a long time before I need it and then only taking out the file way later to 
see how I coded it in so I can get a code I am writing weeks, months, or even years later to work just like that specific 
piece of code. Everything in this is open source, including the exe files, so for that reason I have included the hex code for
all exe files that are put in this repository.
